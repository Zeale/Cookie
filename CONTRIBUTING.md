# Contributing...
### A few simple rules to follow, just so that you don't get in trouble.

1. Don't be stupid.
2. Continue to not be stupid.
3. Be smart.
4. Don't be a piece of trash to others.
5. Feel free to commit whatever, even if it's a single character of a change; as long as it's actually useful.

##### If you see something that you think needs fixing, go ahead and fork the repo and attempt your own fix, if you want. I'm pretty lenient on contributions, and whatever I get will probably be better than what I have.
##### If you literally have nothing to do, and you just want to code something, feel free to create random issues for features or whatever. Maybe fix some issues yourself if you feel like it.
