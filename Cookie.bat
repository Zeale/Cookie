Welcome to COOKIE. A couple of notes here before the program starts.

1. If you find any characters in this document that appear as boxes, (specifically this:  character),
   then don't worry; that's the escape character. It's used to change the foreground and background color
   of text, along with some other things such as underlining text, or making it bold. You can check out
   'https://stackoverflow.com/a/38617204' for a list of color codes and their outputs.
