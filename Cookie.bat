@ECHO off
GOTO Head

Welcome to COOKIE. A couple of notes here before the program starts.

1. If you find any characters in this document that appear as boxes, (specifically this:  character),
	then don't worry; that's the escape character. It's used to change the foreground and background color
	of text, along with some other things such as underlining text, or making it bold. You can check out
	'https://stackoverflow.com/a/38617204' for a list of color codes and their outputs.

2. The program starts in this file and immediately goes to the head label below, so all of these "notes"
	don't get processed as batch commands.
	
	NOTE: that the :Head label directly leads into the :Command label; there are no needs for GOTO
	statements since the :Command label directly proceeds the :Head label. After :Head is done, :Command is
	run.

3. All my "TODO" markings have been stated with 4 semicolons, rather than only two. This makes them slightly
	easier to find.

4. NOTE: If you find a "^" character infornt of any closing parentheses inside an if block, don't remove it.
	It's used to escape the parenthesis.
	
		Remember that batch parses for syntax errors before it begins execution. Batch parses the following IF statement...
	
		IF EXIST "C:\Potato\NUL" (
			ECHO This is a message.
			:: () <- Ha ha lol. This crashes batch.
		)
	
		...like so:
	
		1. Read the 'IF EXIST "C:\..."'
			â€¢ Batch recognizes the IF block and makes sure that the code inside it is syntactically correct. 
			(It won't check for syntax errors inside nested IF blocks yet.)
		2. Read the ECHO statement.
			â€¢ This is a valid statement; move on.
		3. Read the "comment."
			â€¢ Batch sees the opening parenthesis and finds it ok, then it sees the closing parenthesis and 
			closes the IF block... We can get around this by escaping it, using "^)" instead of ")".
		4. Read the closing parenthesis on the bottom line.
			â€¢ "There is a parenthesis here. The author must've made a mista-"
