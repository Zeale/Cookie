<h3 align="center">Welcome to Cookie</h3>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p align="center">Cookie is a random batch application separated into modules. Modules are stored and uploaded here, to github, in this repository, and Cookie can install them with a single command. Althought the program comes with some out-of-the-box features, *those features are trash, and you will likely find no use in them whatsoever*, so please, download whatever modules you want. Go crazy.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p align="center">More modules will be released at random times so check back every once in a while for updates or new features.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p align="center">I'll attempt to to add an autoupdater sort of thing to the program with version checks and other crap soon, but I might just end up shooting myself, I mean, the program is solely written in batch, so...</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p align="center">Anyways, I'll update this README, the repository description, and maybe add some changelog/news files or some crap to keep things updated. Also check out this batch program because it's now my competitor:
